![](snake.png?raw=true)  
Use the arrow keys to move around and collect food. Be careful not to hit a wall(the sides of your terminal or the scoreboard) or yourself. Press 'p' or spacebar to pause.  

The longer you play, the faster you go. Eventually, food will start being worth more and more points.
